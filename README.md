# Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance is a metric do determine the number of differences between two strings. For binary strings, it is calculated as the XOR of the two.

# Examples
The Hamming distance between:
*"ka**rol**in" and "ka**thr**in" is 3.
*"k**a**r**ol**in" and "k**e**r**st**in" is 3.
*10**1**1**1**01 and 10**0**1**0**01 is 2.
*2**17**3**8**96 and 2**23**3**7**96 is 3.
